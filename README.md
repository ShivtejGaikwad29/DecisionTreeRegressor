# DecisionTreeRegressor
This repository contains  implementation of Decision Tree Regression using Pythonâ€™s scikit-learn library. Decision Tree Regression is a popular and intuitive machine learning algorithm used for predicting continuous values by recursively partitioning the data into subsets based on the value of predictor variables.

Key Features

Model Training: Demonstrates how to train a Decision Tree Regressor using scikit-learn, including hyperparameter tuning for optimal performance.
Practical Examples: Contains practical examples and use cases to illustrate the application of Decision Tree Regression in real-world scenarios.
